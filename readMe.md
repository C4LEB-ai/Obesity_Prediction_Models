# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Obesity Prediction and Classification


### Short Description
This project focuses on developing and evaluating various machine learning and deep learning models to predict and classify obesity levels. The models developed include logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, convolutional neural network (CNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Among these, the random forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy, making it a highly effective model for obesity classification.

## Introduction/Objective
Obesity is a widespread health issue that contributes to numerous chronic diseases and higher mortality rates. Accurate prediction and classification of obesity levels are crucial for early intervention and effective management, ultimately easing the strain on healthcare systems.

This project focuses on developing and assessing various machine learning and deep learning models to predict and classify obesity. The goal is to determine the most accurate model, offering healthcare professionals and policymakers a powerful tool to more effectively address and manage obesity.

Key objectives of this project include:

- **Developing and training** multiple machine learning and deep learning models for obesity prediction.
- **Evaluating the performance** of each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
- **Identifying the most effective model** for classifying different levels of obesity.
- **Providing insights** into the potential applications of these models in healthcare settings for obesity management and prevention.

## Methodology
The methodology involves several critical steps to ensure the effective development and evaluation of the models:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - A comprehensive dataset related to obesity was collected, including features such as age, gender, dietary habits, physical activity, and BMI.
   - Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Model Development**
   - Various machine learning models were developed, including:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Decision Tree Classifier**
     - **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Additionally, deep learning models were implemented:
     - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
     - **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

3. **Model Training**
   - Each model was trained using the preprocessed dataset.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - The models were evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
   - The random forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 97.16%, making it the best model for obesity classification.
   - The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 91.29%, and the ANN model achieved 90.92%, indicating promising results for deep learning approaches.

5. **Performance Comparison**
   - The performance of all models was compared to identify the most effective one for obesity prediction and classification.
   - The random forest classifier outperformed the others, demonstrating high precision and recall values.

6. **Insight Generation**
   - The results of the study provide valuable insights into the application of machine learning and deep learning models in predicting and classifying obesity.
   - These models can be leveraged by healthcare professionals and policymakers to develop more targeted interventions for obesity prevention and management.
